Running the Disaster Relief System
This is a readme file for the Disaster Relief System project.

Requirements:

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 11 or later. You can check your Java version by running java -version in your command prompt. If you don't have Java installed, you can download and install it from the official website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
Instructions:

Open Command Prompt:

Search for "Command Prompt" in the Windows search bar and open it.
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your project files are located. For example, if your project files are in a folder named disaster-relief-system on your Desktop, you would use the following command:

cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\disaster-relief-system
Replace YourUsername with your actual username.

Run the Program:

The provided command uses an argument file to run the program. You can copy and paste the entire command you mentioned into the command prompt and press Enter. The command should look something like this:

'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin\java.exe' '@C:\Users\Aadi\AppData\Local\Temp\cp_3eyp62o5kee1ahp6fsx4ayiz9.argfile' 'edu.ucalgary.oop.Main'
Alternatively:

a. If you know the location of the java.exe file (usually in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin), you can directly execute the program using the class name:

 ```
 java edu.ucalgary.oop.Main
 ```
b. Make sure the directory containing the project's .class files is included in your system's classpath environment variable. This allows you to run the program using just the class name without specifying the full path.

Interact with the Program:

The program will start and provide a menu for managing disaster victims and inquiries (although the inquiry section is not fully implemented yet). Follow the on-screen instructions to create, search, edit, or display information about disaster victims.
Additional Notes:

This is a basic guide to running the program. The specific steps might vary depending on your system configuration.
The provided command with the argument file might be specific to your development environment. The alternative methods (3a and 3b) offer more general ways to run the program.
If you encounter any errors, make sure you have the required Java version installed and the project files are in the correct location.
For further assistance, refer to the project documentation or contact the program developer.
